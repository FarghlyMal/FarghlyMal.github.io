Hello Geeks today I am going to talk about continuous attacks but in different way and different weapons but they have the same technique

Emotet is one the most famous Malware in the Scene today and It ranks 2th according to [ANY.RUN](https://any.run/malware-trends/) in 16\3\2023,

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*qQBTmFGMSeUqMg_E4-Glgg.png)

we will dive into details in some places and will not in others, let’s go………

Emotet is designed to be a Banking Trojan that steals Banking information, it shipped to victims via phishing emails campaigns and the emails are attached to a word document file and the mail content asks you to open this file

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*CrsA2-v049vIos2_Zg-DCQ.png)

phishing emails

this file contains Macro Code and this macro will run a PowerShell script, I guess this code will download 2stage malware and run it

# Code Analysis for 2stage malware

let’s check the properties of the sample in PEstudio the malware is packed and all its strings are encrypted I think we have hard work here

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*CR2XUc_ctJOX15ie-M3-Eg.png)

PeStudio view

# Dynamic API Resolving

let’s go deep into the code of this sample and get its behavior, the piece has no direct calls to API, but I found a suspicious call here in the Start function it’s **Call dword_40FAF8** and this refers to dynamic API Resolving

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:670/1*X8x3jviPSnSQFxJ_YSKmNA.png)
so the first 2 calls are responsible for API Resolving and if we go and debug them I think we will get a good result, let’s check them in the debugger

before debugging these 2 functions are referred to by the pink arrow and the API call is referred to by the blue arrow

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*B3aqV_saqDfVzUkQaMG4zA.png)
if we take another look at the debugger after its small job we will see that these 2 function resolves APIs related to **ntdll** & **kernel32dll** and the call below is a call to **GetModuleFileNameW()**

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*FsG_vNM9GVVzS1z79RwzAg.png)
so let’s take a dump for the pe and load it into **IDA** to make our navigation easier

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:539/1*Uqtj0ehJxKTHNqeK_BFjMw.png)

# Get-Module Name Hash

we will complete our analysis using IDA Concurrently with 64dbg, the call to **sub_201144** is to create a hash to the module name(de5e79a0), and malware after that goes to decrypt the string using **sub_201A52** we will rename it cause I think the author will use it many times in its peace, after that it prints the decrypt str with module name hash using **_snwprintf**

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:614/1*GXBVR6wSgapjIIBXle9K8g.png)

after that, the malware frees the heap which is used to decrypt, and then it gets the command used to run the application, I think malware gets this to check if it runs **via macros or not,** the sample compares the length of the command line with the length of printed string above

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:660/1*siRutGeEEzkxYn4V1vZkYQ.png)

this comparison will specify the path of the sample and I will force it to go to its core to complete our analysis, in **sub_20ABE5** which is a gate to Core behavior, it calls GetTickCount which will compare it after a few commands to check if it's being debugged using a debugger or not

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:489/1*oT9J1zh2tmO-LyLzf5Gj5A.png)
# Allocate Volume Serial

then the malware gets the Volume Serial Number and saves it

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:650/1*nBHs3QBfJ1CWs7cZMUgKUQ.png)

# Mutex Creation

then the sample decrypts some strings and uses them as mutex and events to check if this malware had been executed before or not, this mutex is unique due to my Volume Serial number, in your case it’s deferent

-   Global\ICB5F4CF
-   Global\MCB5F4C

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:603/1*UHcYoQoVyImPYocOdAqL8w.png)
and here is mutex handles

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:666/1*xZ5BfLrcgQwqXIsBL8dXUg.png)

# Make A Decision

getting into sub_20AB26 which is considered Malware Core, we see that the malware has a global flag and due to its value the peace specifies its path (1 or 2, or 3)

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*JsOyepgSEjtnXRb0khQG4g.png)
the malware will call this function more than one time and every time it will take a different path so we will go with the sample and let it lead us to know what it will do,

so first path the malware will Resolve some API

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:430/1*nfa8nUID2pTZkGJDBsyQ1A.png)
# Behave_1
let’s dive into **Behave_1** Function

the malware starts by trying to open Service Control Manager and get a handle on it,

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:853/1*S9vDvIoVFEv6DlQe3O6e6g.png)

then it gets the name of the process after that it decrypts some strings and concatenates 2 strings of them to create **the EXE** name

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*4OkjFsztfAG1G_47-oWtCQ.png)

and here is a list of decrypted strings
```
engine,finish,magnify,resapi,query,skip,wubi,svcs,router,crypto,backup,hans,xcl,con,edition,wide,loada,themes,syc,pink,tran,khmer,chx,excel,foot,wce,allow,
play,publish,fwdr,prep,mspterm,nop,define,chore,shlp,maker,proc,cap,top,tablet,sizes,without,pen,
dasmrc,move,cmp,rebrand,pixel,after,sms,minimum,umx,cpls,tangent,resw,class,colors,generic,license,mferror,kds,keydef,cabl
```
then it gets a specified string from them and I think it’s unique due to some calculation related to **the Volume Serial Number** in my case it is **(querypen.exe)**

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:873/1*gHhq5DLiTHdbOdOyrEPHeg.png)

# Prepare for Moving itself

**,** then it gets the path to drop malware and the decision here is based on if it can open SCManager Or Not, if it can it will open **1** if not it will open **2** in the below file

> **_1- C:\\Windows\SysWOW64\qerypen.exe_**

**_OR_**

> **_2- C:\\Windows\Users\Username\AppData\Local\querypen\querypen.exe_**

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*Cnmr-M_Ff6__X6c9tnqdrA.png)

then it maps the file into memory to Calc CRC32 Check for the current process application and I think it does this to check the integrity of Emotet,

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*PzgYMYWILUxKS6z0WQkKMQ.png)

after that, it concatenates pc name and serial number in String and I think this data will be saved to be sent to C2

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:350/1*PEP9jRy5_xyRM_RG_Azt_g.png)
# Removing Old Variants

after that it allocates some strings and captures a specified string from this list and here is the list of it

chunk,counter,drawa,isve,two,next,mapi,rtapi,nlsdl,defs,tenant,rstrt,window,machine,mira,system,stream,cursor,structs,history,watched,hash,report,program,durable,offc,rsat,folders,shell,  
yellow,sounds,adjust,toner,tlb,sorted,loop,post,txt,icons,intel,inset,move,reports,trc,based,wim,lumber,violet,dom,easy,cvt,center,even,readand,xinput,mem,cues,layer,tools,wfd,running,mail,gesture,mis

after getting the string and getting WOW64 path here is the full path the malware resolved

> **C:\Windows\SysWOW64\layerreadand.exe**

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:239/1*IhtobOO09zcRG5UsCZmmHA.png)
and then the malware **deletes** this file if it found it, and I think it does this to avoid something related to autoinfection or whatever

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:676/1*LbkDhnqXngSShRu5ttdk9g.png)

Complementing the process of preventing self-infection with the malicious program, the malware makes a comparison between the process's full path and resolved application, If they were identical the malware will return and end this function and I think it completes the loop

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*UyqtgG0lw28yvBlZcT8aGw.png)

# Copying Itself

after that, the malware tries to copy itself using [**SHFileOperatoinW()**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/shellapi/nf-shellapi-shfileoperationw), and here is the trick, the sample doesn’t use a direct API to copy or move the file it wants to drop or whatever, it does this using the above API and this API uses a specified structure called [**SHFILEOPSTRUCTA**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/shellapi/ns-shellapi-shfileopstructa) as argument and there is an element in this structure determine the operation called **wFunc** and in our case it but **ebx** value into this element **= 1** which refers to Copying Operation, and after calling the API there is a value saved in **fAnyOperationsAborted** element and this value indicates if the operation succeeds or not

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*8LTBjFoLNh_eExwyLr-FBg.png)

and if the Calling fails to do its job or if there are any aborted errors, it will try another method to do this copying job by getting temp path **%temp% and** creating a temporary file with random name **[random].tmp** and in my case, it creates this file

> **C:\Users\Hack\AppData\Local\Temp\8E68.tmp**

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*zPal8rl7rHJbs76FhPoEYQ.png)

temp file

and I think it will copy itself into the temp file and then copy the temp file in

> **C:\Windows\SYSWOW64\querypen.exe**

using the same method used before by calling [**SHFileOperatoinW()**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/shellapi/nf-shellapi-shfileoperationw)  but in this case, the elements of the structure passed will be changed

> _pto→_ **_C:\Windows\SysWOW64\querypen.exe_**
> 
> _pfrom →_ **_C:\Users\Hack\AppData\Local\Temp\8E68.tmp_**

and here is how temp file [8E68].tmp after calling the API

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*E7QugQMrYc18-NKWcqcing.png)

after copying its payload into **querypen.exe it tries to delete**

> **_C:\Windows\SysWOW64\querypen.exe:Zone.Identifier_**

and zone identifier refers in windows to ADS _|_ **_deleting the Zone.Identifier ADS will remove the security information associated with the file, and may cause Windows to treat the file as if it was downloaded from an unknown or untrusted source, which could trigger additional security warnings or restrictions_**

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:549/1*4JNnfIM_J_8WxG2nOl4mcw.png)

and here is a conclusion about the first path of the sample if we want to summarize the previous explanation that the Malware Drop itself into the SySWow64 path and then it will try to run this copy

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:649/1*1XrHUw7bzwk49Z5se3XL4w.png)

# **Run The Copy**

after that, the malware has 2 options

-   start executing dropped file normally if opening **SC Manager** Failed

**OR**

-   Create a Service with the EXE for more resistance

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:633/1*sNJl3GdBoQ-rvsgcVanSQA.png)

if malware can open SC Manager it starts to create its Services with a description to trick users with this description “C**opies user certificates and root certificates from smart cards into the current user’s certificate store, detects when a smart card is inserted into a smart card reader, and, if needed, installs the smart card Plug and Play mini driver**”

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*76B1wpEVuW5O_mHiKp6P3w.png)
I **| calc.exe** | in the path in which the service will run EXE and renamed it with **querypen.exe,** every time windows start it will start the service automatically

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:615/1*z1ybt5lGA-lNLq-JfMVypA.png)
and after creating the service and making it **autostart,** I suspended it due to control the execution of the parent sample

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*H7vM4Fe5Q7DmhzEERju95g.png)
if the malware fails to open SCManager it will run the process normally

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*MyVn3aMeULRYBTh0bC1Hrw.png)
after that, the malware will move 1 into the global flag if it failed to run the dropped malware **(malware himself) or 3 if it succeeded**

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:779/1*Zu6u3J8B0s2kJYjsM764cg.png)
# **Second Decision**

after dropping the malware in the temp path and running it, the malware is trying to go the second decision based on the global flag set before

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:871/1*AhxUMxpEtPzBXHBAmHAQ2w.png)
# API Resolving

we will dive into these functions one by one

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:598/1*OcjM8o5QO-wxnihrp-S01w.png)

the method is like that, the malware use stack values to evade AVs and then decrypts the library name and loads it, then with these passed hashes it’s going to resolve all needed APIs

the first 5 functions are related to dynamic resolving for API needed for this state of malware I will go over them with the debugger and show you the result,

Resolved APIs**(Crypt32, UrlMon, UserEnv, WinInet, WtsApi).dll**

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:563/1*DvFTeGyEclTH0T0N3ElfZg.png)

# Encryption Preparation

after loading APIs, Malware here is preparing for Encryption using Windows APIs [**CryptAcquireContextW()**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-cryptacquirecontexta) **using RSA_AES** Alograthims to build its Encryption Dashboard

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*_aPHByrvhjmQo990DfBS_g.png)

then the malware creates a key using [**CryptGenKey()**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-cryptgenkey)
```C
CryptGenKey(  
  [in]  HCRYPTPROV hProv,  
  [in]  ALG_ID     Algid,  
  [in]  DWORD      dwFlags,  
  [out] HCRYPTKEY  *phKey  
);  
  
//and that's how the author call this api  
  
  
CryptGenKey(hprov,CALG_AES_128,1,pHKey2);  
  
//and that's the algorthim generate a public key used in encryptino and decryptino  
//the key genrated by the API calling after tracing pHkey2 argument  
/* -   
50 82 93 71 A0 B2 94 71 D0 74 93 71 80 CC 94 71  
A0 53 93 71 B0 57 93 71 10 63 93 71 80 9D 94 71   
A0 92 93 71 D0 BA 94 71 E8 3C 8E 00 74 AB CA E3  
*/ 

then the author tries to create a Call [**CryptCreateHash()**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-cryptcreatehash)  to start hashing dashboard by calling this API and here is how it’s done

push    offset phash    ; phHash  
push    0               ; dwFlags  
push    0               ; hKey  
push    CALG_SHA        ; Algid  
push    hProv           ; hProv  
call    CryptCreateHash  
  
//phash --> will contain handle to Hash Object created   
//and here is the hash object  
/* follow this   
C0 6F 93 71 10 50 93 71 F0 AA 94 71 30 4C 93 71  
60 F5 94 71 20 5C 93 71 70 51 93 71 B0 5E 93 71   
70 A9 94 71 E8 3C 8E 00 E4 9E CA E3 33 33 33 33   
01 00 00 00  
*/  
  ```

after Encryption Preparation the malware decided to go to the third decision by setting a global flag with 2, then the malware do its loop and go again to the Malware_Core function

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*ucLnzOD5DR0cwBjTY0rZ1w.png)

# **Third Decision**

the sample here is going to take another route with another behavior and it’s going to execute **the sub_20AA19** function

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*WbClabDNFEDvnjQPOpTwqA.png)

# ALLocate System METADATA

As usual, let’s get dive into this function

the binary starts this path by collecting info about PC using [**RtlGetVersion()**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-rtlgetversion) and [**GetNativeSystemInfo()**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-getnativesysteminfo)  APIs

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:819/1*XSY85CLGQfE9YMGrfbuI-g.png)

after that, it allocates all system processes via [**CreateToolHelpSnapShot()**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/tlhelp32/nf-tlhelp32-createtoolhelp32snapshot)

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:803/1*jCdOFd5VA7jaFmgFe4gd7A.png)

# LinkedList Creation

after some reversing the author uses **LinkedList DataStructure** to save the process name and a hash of every name, and it does this way by allocating a heap and copying the process name into it as **figure 1,** it saves the name of the process 4 bytes away and let the first 4 bytes to save the address of the next list

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:771/1*4EmE04qlKUd2SbSxelY-_w.png)

figure1

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*AfUynrl3hQNSvglQ6lXxow.png)<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u>(1): <u> </u> </font></center> 

LinkedList Creation

here is a code snippet of the above image
```C
push    [ebp+lpString2] ; lpString2  
lea     ecx, [esi+4]  
push    ecx             ; lpString1  
call    lstrcpyW  
mov     [esi+20Ch], ebx ; ebx = --> process name hash  
mov     ecx, [edi]  
mov     [esi], ecx  
mov     [edi], esi       ; edi = arg_4 = addresses for the heaps which  
                        ; contain process name's and it's hashes  
  
// if want to explain that code we need to know the value of the registers   
// after calling lstrcopyw this below is the status of the Registers  
so   
/* ebx = 04C0407d    --> that a hash for process name    
   esi = 008F8560    --> it's a heap allocated before only to save this process node   
   ecx = 00000000    --> in the next loops ecx will contain the value of the above node  
   edi = 0038FA42    --> this address will save the address of the first node of the list  
  ```
so in the next loop the ecx register will contain the address of the node before   
this address will be saved into the first 4 bytes before the name of the process  
in the heap which we  have mentioned before 

so to summarize this, the first node created is the last node in the LinkedList and the address of the first will be saved into [edi], so if we take a look into memory after building the LinkedList

the **EDI value is pointed by a blue arrow and the address of the first node is pointed by a pink arrow**

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:870/1*PfcRI9XkZChspUmztLdArg.png)

if we dump the address of the first node pointed by a pink arrow, here is the result ….

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*3l-Pln-_hymoqxa9WJQiog.png)<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u>(): <u>first node </u> </font></center> 



if we dump also the address in the first 4 bytes pointed by a pink arrow,it will lead us to the next node

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*EzuhZ9rojAErQZhXq_yrsg.png)

and if we keep tracing the first 4 Bytes of every heap it will lead us to the next node this LinkedList till we reach the last node so in its heap the first 4 bytes will = be 00000000 and here is the result

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*KbMNGkPRQLhPCzMMHigIqg.png)<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u>(): <u>last node </u> </font></center> 

# Collect Data

then it starts by iterating over these heaps and getting the length of all process names and then allocates a heap with that length and copies all process names into another heap I think it is preparing to send them to **C2**

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*Q3wLqOUHA4WSqENukcbV4Q.png)
<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u>(): <u>copying process</u> </font></center> 


and here is how this heap looks like in memory

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*5KRtmzsyyZz4Fju0sulkYw.png)<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u>(): <u>the heap contains all running process names</u> </font></center> 



after that, it starts by collecting the gathered data into one heap and here I think it ends the data collecting job and is ready to encrypt them and then send it to **C2 Server as we see in the next figure it concatenates these values**

-   PC Name → **_referred by pink color_**
-   [C:] Serial number → **_referred by yellow color_**
-   all names of running process → **_referred by red color_**

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:866/1*aQ7ygIL3C7bUCbWKog5-XA.png)<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u>(): <u>data allocated</u> </font></center> 


# 1_Stage of Encryption

then the malware starts its own encryption and compression stages, and after tracing heaps allocated, the author had built his own encryption and compression algorithms which is very difficult to trace or reverse, so I put Read Hardware breakpoints to stop the program if it read any data from the above heap and try to trace the execution to get more understanding of this behavior…………

## so if take a look at the calling for function reside at 0x5EB6 ,,, it takes 3 pushes

-   data length
-   ptr to allocated data
-   ptr to heap → saved in ECX register

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*_5y50AktLHG7mRV9XqNAow.png)

so we are ready to run the malware until it hit any breakpoint

here is what I got
```
// here data before any operation  
/* length = 0x1DAh = 474

// Data after compersion and first stage of Encryptiom  
// there many chars that have no meaning for you but for Computer it does  
/* compressed Data

*/  
```
in the above section, we saw how the data was compressed and the difference between after and before compression, and also how the data looks after encryption

length before = 474

length after =304

# 2_Stage Encryption

here the author is going to the 2_stage of encryption

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:816/1*UrRw00pmUwxWCKZ3t5F4wg.png)

and here is the code in c

as I told you before there some chars are not readable to humans but Computers Can Manipulate these chars

# C2 Connection

so everything is ready for communication establishment with C2

we are going throw C2 Connection Dashboard and will explain how this work

-   first, it starts with resolving the IP address Emotet is famous for the many IPs it can connect to it, so if we look at the next figure we will see it’s resolving its IPs address which is saved in **edx**

**Decryption_Related_2 → var contains the IP address**

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*-REr1rSR8uqVcRZbkAbbNQ.png)

in my case, it resolved this IP address **_201.184.105.242_** but there is a list of all IP addresses I got this data by using ChatGPT to extract IPs and identify which country of each IP

# IPs and their corresponding countries

Awesome this is what we got let’s complete it,

# **Extracting Full Link**

the Malware Decrypt some Strings as file names and before and capture a string from them due to Serial_number, but in this case, it will do it due to pc time using [**GetTickCount()**](http://dd)**,** and here is what I get

full link :  
Referer: http://201.184.105.242/cone/bml/  
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded  
DNT: 

Here is a list of all encrypted links

teapot,pnp,tpt,splash,site,codec,health,balloon,  
cab,odbc,badge,dma,psec,cookies,iplk,devices,enable,  
mult,prov,vermont,attrib,schema,iab,chunk,publish,prep,  
srvc,sess,ringin,nsip,stubs,img,add,xian,jit,free,pdf,  
loadan,arizona,tlb,forced,results,symbols,report,guids,  
taskbar,child,cone,glitch,entries,between,bml,usbccid,  
sym,enabled,merge,window,scripts,raster,acquire,json,rtm,  
walk,ba

then the malware gets the user agent using [**ObtainUserAgetString()**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/platform-apis/ms775114(v=vs.85))

and here is the user agent it extract of our sandbox

Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.2; WOW64;   
Trident/7.0; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.30729;   
.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

# Connection Establishment

then the malware starts the process of communication with C2 by calling this APIs
```C
InternetOpenW(  
			lpszAgent,  
			 dwAccessType,  
			lpszProxy,  
			lpszProxyBypass,  
			dwFlags  
);  
  
InternetConnectA(  
			hInternet,  
			lpszServerName,  
			nServerPort,  
			lpszUserName,  
			lpszPassword,  
			dwService,  
			dwFlags,  
			dwContext  
);   
HttpOpenRequestA(  
			hConnect,  
			lpszVerb,  
			lpszObjectName,  
			lpszVersion,  
			lpszReferrer,  
			*lplpszAcceptTypes,  
			dwFlags,  
			dwContext  
);  
  
HttpSendRequestA(  
			hRequest,  
			lpszHeaders,  
			dwHeadersLength,  
			lpOptional,  
			dwOptionalLength  
);  
```
let’s explain them one by one

`**InternetOpenW**` is a Windows API function that initializes an application's use of the WinINet functions. This function returns a handle that can be used in subsequent calls to other WinINet functions.

`**InternetConnectW**` is a function in the Windows API that establishes a connection to a specified internet server. It takes in parameters such as the handle to the internet session, the server name or IP address, the port number, the username and password for authentication, and more. Once the connection is established, it returns a handle to the newly created FTP or HTTP session, which can then be used to perform operations such as file downloads or uploads.

`**HttpOpenRequestW**` is a function in the Windows API that is used to initiate an HTTP request on a given HTTP session

`**HttpSendRequestW**` is a function provided by the Windows API to send an HTTP request to a server. It takes as input a HINTERNET handle, which is returned by the `**HttpOpenRequestW**` function, and a pointer to a buffer containing any optional data to be sent with the request

here is how our sample call HttpSendReques and the passed parameters

I forgot to tell you that the author had encoded the multi-encrypted allocated data using base64 so it’s refered by second arrow
```C

```
# Download 3_stage

so there is no Reply form C2 and we will miss something related to 3 stages of the malware cause it allocates a heap and then call **InternetReadFile()** which is responsible for downloading Data from the Server

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*s8FzUbcYwIIF-JBCFCRXFg.png)

# Decryption of Downloaded Data | 1_Stage

let’s assume that the C2 replies to us and now the heap contains a multi-encrypted **PF file** so the malware is going to decrypt this stage using its own decryptor and using windows API used before for encryption but here it uses the decryption ones using  [**CryptDecrypt()**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-cryptdecrypt)

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*Kq3fn935f9YQWUPqd6shVg.png)

# **2_Stage**

and here is the function related to the second stage of decryption, it’s a very big function and very hard to reverse so if it faces you run it with the debugger and check the output using **breakpoints in the allocated heaps**

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*BjxQmVDw349lxJhSgMLMUw.png)

# resistance via Registry

so the malware has ended its C2 Communication Dashboard and Decrypt next stage so it needs more resistance in the machine so it does this by creating a registry key

> _SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run_

and then create a key with value querypen.exe so if we take a look at the registry

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*HIr9lqcmmbTcAA6Ig1ncMw.png)

# Dropping 3 Stage

after achieving resistance on the device, the malware starts to write and drop its third stage which has been downloaded before from C2 and the name of the file is unique due to calling GetTickCount and using it to identify the name of the dropped file

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*SCUDu8sohml_tNLG5QmuZg.png)

> _C:\Windows\SysWOW64\fsF5.exe → is the name of the dropped file_

after resolving the name the malware starts to write the file on the desk, But unfortunately, we have no reply from C2 Server so there is no file to write, but if we point to another file to start like [hello world file ]and copy it’s PE File into the buffer pointed by **_edi_** register in the next figure

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:753/1*TXJJupIDdudF6zhU1Xtyeg.png)

so we copy our file binaries into the memory of our sample

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*eKspwUMDjTpnhvQm8Mcbig.png)

so we need to complete and see how the file will be executed

the author uses [**CreateFileW()**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea) to create a file in WoW64 path
```C
CreateFileA(  
lpFileName,  
dwDesiredAccess,  
dwShareMode,  
pSecurityAttributes,  
dwCreationDisposition,  
dwFlagsAndAttributes,  
hTemplateFile  
);  
// lp file name --> C:\Windows\SysWOW64\fsF5.exe  

  ```
so let’s execute the API and look into the Explorer for the file, we will see that the file has been created and its SIZE = 0

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*9HBoBhb9GIip4PFoCmJafg.png)

as we expected the author now will write data in this file, but it will write the data we copied into its memory using [**WriteFile()**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-writefile) API

  ```C
WriteFile(  
			hFile,  
			lpBuffer,  
			nNumberOfBytesToWrite,  
			lpNumberOfBytesWritten,  
			lpOverlapped  
);  

  ```
![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*aePOLMK-Umx9E0fh0wUpSA.png)

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*3a_SC_X7vexiqZLTU7oNcQ.png)

then the author will run this dropped file using [**CreateProcessW()**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessa)

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*WLBV2V6or-5gVJgFHU8DkA.png)

But unfortunately, I have a compiling error that makes the dropped file fails to run correctly anyway that is not what we will put our attention

So, if we want to summarize this program, it collects information about the device and then sends it to C2, and then it gets another Malware with different capabilities and behavior then it will run it, the power of EMOTET is data individuality, what you get in your sandbox is different from what i get due to Some Randomization and decryption related to uniquely pc data such

> Dropped File Name
